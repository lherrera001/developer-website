# Command details

## `nr1 nerdpack:clone`

### Clone an existing Nerdpack
Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from [our Open Source GitHub repositories](https://opensource.newrelic.com/explore-projects/). After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack:
1. Clones the repository.
2. Sets the repository as remote upstream.
3. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm).
4. Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it.

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION`

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `-r, --repo=REPO`  | Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). **(Required)** |
|  `-p, --path=PATH`  | Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). |
|  `-f, --force`      |   Replaces destination folder if it exists. |
|  `--profile=PROFILE`| The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

## `nr1 nerdpack:serve`
### Serve your Nerdpack locally
Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the [Simplify One platform](https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local), where it can be tested live. 

To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to [serve, publish, and deploy documentation](/build-apps/publish-deploy/).

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:serve` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `--profile=PROFILE`| The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

## `nr1 nerdpack:uuid`
### Get your Nerdpack's UUID
Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the `-g` or `--generate` option.

For more details, see [our GitHub workshop](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workshop/blob/master/lab-cli/INSTRUCTIONS.md) on GitHub.

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:uuid` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `--profile=PROFILE`| The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `-f, --force`      | If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. |
|  `-g, --generate`   | Generates a new UUID if not available. |
|  `--verbose`        | Adds extra information to the output. |

## `nr1 nerdpack:publish`
### Publish your Nerdpack
Publishes your Nerdpack to Simplify. 

Please note:
* If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. 
* If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the `--channel` option. For example, `$ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE`.
* If you want to disable this behavior, add `-D` or `--skip-deploy` to the command. Then, you can use `nr1 nerdpack:deploy` to perform a deploy manually.

For more on publishing and deploying, see [Deploy to Simplify One](/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/publish-deploy).

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:publish` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
| `-B, --skip-build`                           | Skips the previous build process. |
| `-D, --skip-deploy`                          | Skips the following deploy process. |
| `-c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE`              | Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] |
|  `-f, --force`                               |  Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. |
|  `--dry-run`                                 | Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. |
|  `--extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path` | Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] |
|  `--prerelease=STRING`                       | The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. |
|  `--profile=PROFILE`                         | The authentication profile you want to use. |
|  `--verbose`                                 | Adds extra information to the output. |

## `nr1 nerdpack:deploy`
### Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel
Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. 

For more on publishing and deploying, see [Deploy to Simplify One](/build-tools/new-relic-one-applications/publish-deploy).

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION` 

### Options

|---|---|
|  `-c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE` | Specifies the channel to deploy to. **(required)** |
|  `-i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID` | Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. |
|  `--from-version=VERSION`        | Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. |
|  `--profile=PROFILE`             | The authentication profile you want to use. |

## `nr1 nerdpack:undeploy`
### Undeploy your Nerdpack
Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). 

### Usage
`$ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION` 

### Options
| | |
|---|---|
|  `-c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE` | Specifies the channel to undeploy from. **(required)** |
|  `-i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID` | Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. |
|  `--profile=PROFILE`             | The authentication profile you want to use. |
