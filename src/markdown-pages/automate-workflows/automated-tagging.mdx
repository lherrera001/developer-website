At Simplify, we are always looking for challenging problems to solve. One of the things we've been working on lately is figuring out ways for our developers to experience different aspects of Simplify so they can more quickly build on the platform, find a solution to a specific use case, or just learn something new (which is always fun!). 

One of the frameworks that we are working on enables our various teams to define and spin up complete environments, from infrastructure to applications to instrumentation. Like many internal frameworks, this has undergone several iterations; and in fact, we are in the midst right now of major refactor. Because of our commitment to open source, we wanted to start working in the open early in the process and invite you to collaborate with us. Drop any thoughts & comments in the [Build on Simplify](https://discuss.newrelic.com/c/build-on-new-relic) support thread and let us know what you think! 

OK, let's jump in!

## Overview

One of the things that we've learned is that keeping your stack organized can be challenging, especially as resources come and go. One strategy to help with this is to apply tags in a consistent manner across your estate. In this guide, you will provision a host on your cloud provider, deploy a simple node.js app on that host, instrument both with Simplify agents, and then apply a consistent tagging strategy across all the resources--all 'automagically'. (Not really, it's mostly Ansible under the covers.) 

**Remember** Make sure to do the **Teardown** step at the end to decommision the entities that we provision in this guide. 


## Before you begin
To run this example there are several pre-requisite steps, most of which involve setting up the right configurations, and at least for now, building a [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) image. 

We use several of our open source projects to make this all work. Let's take a look at them now.
* [Demo Deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer) - This is the engine that drives all the automation. For convenience, you'll clone this repo and build a docker image. In future iterations, we'll publish the image in docker hub or someplace similar. 
* [Demo Nodetron](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-nodetron) - This is the simple app that will be provisioned on a host. It will give you a simple web page and an API that you can hit with a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) depending on how much traffic you want to generate. 
* [Demo Simplify Instrumentation](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation) - This is the project that we use to layer in the instrumentation for the infrastructure and the application. 

We kept each project distinct to encapsulate its behavior. The idea being that we can simply add more behaviors and then weave them in to assemble more complex scenarios. Cool, right?

<Steps>

<Step>

### Build the Deployer
Let's get the deployer built. Essentially, this is cloning the repo and building the docker image. If you don't have docker installed, you can download it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

* Clone the deployer repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer.git $HOME/deployer
```

* Build the docker image

```bash
docker build -t deployer .
```
</Step>

<Step>

### Create Config files
In this example, we will actually provision a host on either AWS or Asure, depending on which one you choose. The deployer that you just built, uses a configuration file that has references your creds so it can invoke the necessary APIs. The instructions to create your configuration file are [here](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer/blob/main/documentation/user_config/README.md). In the end, you will have something that looks similar to the file on the right. 

```json
{
  "credentials": {

    "aws": {
      "apiKey": "my_aws_api_key",
      "secretKey": "my_aws_secret_key",
      "secretKeyPath": "/path/to/my/secretkey.pem",
      "region": "my_aws_region"
    },

    "azure": {
      "client_id": "my_client_id",
      "tenant": "my_tenant_id",
      "subscription_id": "my_subscription_id",
      "secret": "my_secret",
      "region": "my_region",
      "sshPublicKeyPath": "/path/to/my/id_rsa.pub"
    },

    "newrelic": {
      "licenseKey": "my_new_relic_license_key",
      "insightsInsertApiKey": "my_new_relic_insights_api_key",
      "accountId": "my_new_relic_account_id"
    }
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Let's run this thing!
Now that everything is setup, you can run the deployer in the docker image. Because this is actually provisioning infrastructure, deploying apps, etc. it will take a few minutes. Go ahead and invoke the command and then we'll walk through what's happening.

```bash
docker run -it\
    -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\
    --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/[user].docker.local.json -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json
```

## hello.json
The deployer is configuration driven, and [hello.json](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer/blob/main/documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json) is the default configuration for this example. Looking at this file, you will notice several interesting sections. 
* services
* global_tags
* resources
* instrumentation
These section describe, to the deployer, the actions to take when it executes. For example, "global_tags" will, as the name implies, apply these tags to ALL the resources in your stack. This is how we apply the consistent tagging strategy discussed above. 

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "app1",
      "display_name": "Hello-App1",
      "source_repository": "-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-nodetron.git",

          "<h1>Welcome!</h1>",
          "Congrats! You have successfully setup our <b>Hello World</b> demo environment. So, what's been deployed?",

          "<li>A simple node application that is serving up this page.</li>",
          "<li>Simplify instrumentation, specifically, the infrastructure agent and the node agent.</li></ul>",
          " ",
          "Next, start generating some traffic on the app. This can be done by clicking the <b>Inventory</b> button, which will simply return a collection of items. You can then click each item to see its details.",
          "You can also use postman, or a similar tool to generate a burst of requests. The APIs for the app are quite simple:",
          "<ul><li>Inventory <a href=\"[service:app1]/api/inventory\" target=\"_blank\">[service:app1]/api/inventory</a></li>",

## Your newly deployed stack!
When completed successfully, you should see output similar to what's below. Of course, your URLs will be different, but go ahead and open up a browser on the 'app1' url.

```bash
[INFO] Executing Deployment
[✔] Parsing and validating Deployment configuration success
[✔] Provisioner success
[✔] Installing On-Host instrumentation success
[✔] Installing Services and instrumentations success
[INFO] Deployment successful!

Deployed Resources:

  host1 (aws/ec2):
    ip: 52.90.86.109
    services: ["app1"]
    instrumentation:
       nr_infra: newrelic v1.12.1


Installed Services:

  app1:
    url: http://52.90.86.109:5001
    instrumentation:
       nr_node_agent: newrelic v6.11.0

Completed at 2020-08-20 15:11:14 +0000
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Generate Traffic
The simple node application that was deployed contains a very simple web page that looks similar to the screen shot below. Follow the instructions on this page to generate traffic that will be sent to Simplify.
![Hello World Web Site](../../images/automate-helloworld/helloworld-automationdemo.png)

</Step>

<Step>

## Check out these tags!
Let's head on over to Simplify. We'll use the [search redirect](https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/search/Hello) to quickly find the resources we deployed.

![Search Redirect](../../images/automate-helloworld/global-search.png)

</Step>

<Step>
Once you are in Simplify, you can select either the host or the app that was deployed. By clicking on the 'i' icon next to the name, you'll open the metadata and tags modal. Let's take a look at the host. Notice that all the tags in the "global_tags" section are applied. If you open the application, you'll see that the same tags are also applied. 

![Search Redirect](../../images/automate-helloworld/host-tags.png)

</Step>

<Step> 

## Extra Credit: Create your own configuration file

Create your own configuration and change the global tags! One cool thing you can do is simply pass in a configuration file URL to the deployer. Here's one that uses a gist on GitHub:

```bash
docker run -it\
    -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\
    --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/[user].docker.local.json -d https://gist.githubusercontent.com/markweitzel/d281fde8ca572ced6346dc25470790a5/raw/373166eb50929a0dd23ba5136abf2fa5caf3d369/MarksHelloDemoConfig.json
```


</Step>

<Step>

## Teardown
Because we've provisioned resources in your cloud account, you'll want to ensure to decommision them. This can also be done with the deployer. Add the 'teardown' flag, -t to the end of your command. 

```bash
docker run -it\
    -v $HOME/configs/:/mnt/deployer/configs/\
    --entrypoint ruby deployer main.rb -c configs/[user].docker.local.json -d documentation/tutorial/user_stories/Hello/hello.json -t
```

</Step>
