                Nerd Days is a <b>FREE</b> engineering conference that kicks off
                October 13 <em>(Dates vary by region)</em>. Focused on building
                more perfect software, our goal is to spend less time looking at
                slides that tell you what software can do and more time on
                getting your hands on the software to solve problems
                efficiently.
              </p>
              <p>
                You’ll hear from fellow engineers who built Simplify solutions
                and Simplify users from various industries. Whether you’re new
                or a data nerd, there’s an interactive session for you.
              </p>
              <p>We look forward to building with you during Nerd Days! </p>
